# so based on the instruction, we need to create a program that will ask the user:

    # the questions they want
    # the 4 choices its question have
    # and the correct answer
    # it should also ask if they want another question (so a while loop for sure.)
    # inputs should also be written in a text file.
    # so we'll have to think through the sequence carefully, make sure everything is fit and doesnt interfere with other code blocks.

# so its basically, a quiz maker.

# we'll also try to pull of creative stunts, im planning to import pygame, tkinter, or any 
# library that will make it look very pleasing to the eyes. I think we'll stick to certain creative theme if my ability permits.

# a pseudocode will follow, regarding the execution of this program. 
    # hopefully the sequence wont cause problems and clash with each other.
