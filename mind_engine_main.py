# lets brainstorm this

# our goal is a quiz reader that will read the file created by the quiz creator

# so its main features are:
# individually asking questions
# individually asking answers
# checking how many the user got corect or instant correction
# recording how many questions are correct
# we also need to explore tkinter

# what we need to know so far is:

# how to program a file reader
# convert it to a quiz
# use GUI for creativity

# the aforementioned features would be studied later

    # Part 1 of creating a pseudocode, it must match with our program requirement

        # file reader (we'll use read.file)
        
#so:
        # def load quiz (file = quiz_questions.txt)
            # open the file "r"
                # then file.read

# since our txt file follows a specific format, the code must be able to read it

        # so program it in such a way:
            # each line cutouts = blocks, 1 block = 1 question
            # on our text file it must strip the word "question" and the ABCD aswell
            # we somehow have to extract the text
            

            # once it is working, we need to:
                # srecuture the data so its easy to read
                # once its easy to read we can program it to appear in the GUI


        # use tkinter (explore the library)
            # set the GUI?

        # we need to see videos on how to OOP and tkinter

        # the main problem herre is how we can create a file reader and transfer it to the GUi
        # another problems is the expected features for a working quiz app
        # mendokse
