# lets brainstorm this

# our goal is a quiz reader that will read the file created by the quiz creator

# so its main features are:
# individually asking questions
# individually asking answers
# checking how many the user got corect or instant correction
# recording how many questions are correct
# we also need to explore tkinter

# what we need to know so far is:

# how to program a file reader
# convert it to a quiz
# use GUI for creativity

# the aforementioned features would be studied later

    # Part 1 of creating a pseudocode, it must match with our program requirement

        # file reader

        # open file
            # read file
                # end

        # use tkinter (explore the library)
            # set the GUI?

        # we need to see videos on how to OOP and tkinter

        # the main problem herre is how we can create a file reader and transfer it to the GUi
        # another problems is the expected features for a working quiz app
        # mendokse
