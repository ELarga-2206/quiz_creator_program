# lets brainstorm this

# our goal is a quiz reader that will read the file created by the quiz creator

# so its main features are:
# individually asking questions
# individually asking answers
# checking how many the user got corect or instant correction
# recording how many questions are correct
# we also need to explore tkinter

# what we need to know so far is:

# how to program a file reader
# convert it to a quiz
# use GUI for creativity

# the aforementioned features would be studied later
# 
# added the new line to avoid 'working tree clean'
# testing
# lets change another line of code, to see we can commit normally
# we encounetered a merging error where our last failed 2 commits appeared in our commits
# both in may 3 and may 4
# lets save and try if we can commit normally
